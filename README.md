# endless-pager-jepack-compose

This project demonstrates how to use Android's Jetpack Compose to construct an endless pager. The app allows users to swipe through a list of items continuously without reaching the end. When the user reaches the last item, the pager automatically cycles back to the first item, creating an infinite and uninterrupted flow of items.
